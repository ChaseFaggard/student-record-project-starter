# Student Record Project
Follow the instructions in the TS file

Using TypeScript, do the following:


* Create a function to add student data to an array as an array of 
objects and render objects to the page

*Be sure your function parameters are given strict types*



* Define your data structure using a custom Type.

* Student
    * First name (string)
    * Last name (string)
    * Course  (string)
    * Grade (number or string)
    * isPassing (boolean value if grade is greater than a D)

* If student is passing, render a green symbol/icon next to their entry in the table
* If student is not passing, render a red symbol/icon next to their entry in the table

* It is up to you to calculate based on grade (numerical or letter) if student is passing or not


* Data should be rendered in the form of a table


* Add a button that sorts the data based on Grade (ascending order)
* Add a button that sorts the data based on Course (ascending order)
